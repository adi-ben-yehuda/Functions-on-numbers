# Functions-on-numbers

## Introduction
In this project we will experiment with using common commands, implementing else-if and a loop, defining global variables, and using a library function (printf).

## General Information
This project contains four tasks: 

### Task 1
Print the id.

### Task 2
We will mark the decimal value of the second byte in the binary coding of id when it is interpreted in two's complement terms to be 2_dec. If 2_dec is odd then print the result of multiplying id by 3. Otherwise, if it is even then print the remainder of the division of id by 3.

### Task 3
Perform an xor between the first byte and the third byte in the binary encoding of id. We will mark the received byte as 13_xor, and we will mark the decimal value of 13_xor when it is interpreted in unsigned terms to be dec_unsigned_13. If dec_unsigned_13 is greater than 127 print true, otherwise false.

### Task 4
Print the number of ones in the binary encoding of the fourth byte of id.
